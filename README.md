# Atmega Drivers
## Prerequisites
Add `F_CPU = xx` in Project Properties → Toolchain → AVR/GNU C Complier → Symbols where `xx` is the frequency of the *μC*.
## I2C Driver
I2C driver enables user to use TWI interface to communicate with other *μC* or sensors having I2C interface.
## UART Driver
UART driver enables user to use TWI interface to communicate with other *μC* or communication modules such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi modules, etc.
